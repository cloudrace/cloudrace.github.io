If you have ever wondered how do I get _a hands on experience_ this post  may be helpful for you. I would refer to Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence as ML/AI for the rest of the post.

In an earlier [post](https://cloudrace.info/machine-learning/how_to_get_started/) I discussed about how to get familiarized with some of the key topics and trends with ML/AI. I wanted to do a follow up post if you were interested in trying to get your hands on experience

**_Pick a programming a language_**
* Preferably Python as it is  well regarded in this space
* Others include Julia, R, Java

My colleague Steve Walker pointed out this below note
    
_It’s hard to imagine a machine learning engineer who doesn’t use **Python**. So, if you waited for the right moment to start learning Python, this is that moment.  ~ Andriy Burkov, author of The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book._

**_Pick a Cloud Provider_**
*   My favorite is Google Cloud for several reasons including their research strength in this space, ease of use for developers/data engineers/data scientists, performance and accuracy of the application. 
* Of course there are good options with other cloud providers. Pick what is familiar to you


**_Understand the libraries available_**
* Tensorflow , Keras
* PyTorch
* Scikit Learn
* Numpy, Panda

This would help you to start with coding

**_Focus on a field_**
*   There is a lot to learn in this space, If you are looking to get hands on experience , focus on a specific ML discipline such as Vision, Natural Language, Video etc.,  


**_Join a community_** 
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is the best data science community there is to get experience. Kaggle owned by Google provides tools and resources which could be easily leveraged pretty quickly. Most often for small experiments, they have datasets available with challenges easy to test your skills with. They have a flexibility for you to create your own team


**_Get your hands dirty_**
*   Many free hands on labs are available at [Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/s/results?q=machine%20learning)
*   There are also free Python Notebooks available in [Github](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst) to experiment in [colab](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). Colab owned by Google is completely free for you to use for research purposes

To summarize, I have detailed how to get your hands on experience with key things to consider.
