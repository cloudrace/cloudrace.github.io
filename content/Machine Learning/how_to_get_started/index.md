### with Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence

If you have ever wondered 


*   _how do I get myself up to speed with Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence_ or 
*   _thought the term artificial intelligence has been in existence since 1950s why all the hype now”_

 this post  may be helpful for you. I would refer to Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence as ML/AI for the rest of the post.

Every business challenge in any organization  whether its manual human errors, automating a business process , providing better customer service, recommending a product, understanding the sentiment, getting insights on the trends, predicting natural disasters, estimating vehicle damage, analyzing multiple documents for a summary, processing huge amounts of documents, predicting faults/anomalies. the list goes on. The challenges are endless and the technology is ever evolving.  

We are seeing continuous advancements in various fields, but do you have to be hands on to be an expert. Not necessarily. My colleague [Steve Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-walker-7473368/) mentioned this once “ Do you have to be an expert in the design of a F35 aircraft to fly it or do you have to know just to fly?”.

Overnight none of us can/will become Data Scientists, however there is a lot we can learn and grow. The job roles vary in a wide spectrum with hands on experience, being able to architect and if you are in a leadership role you probably would like to know the impacts of it or guide your team through a strategy. 

Mahatma Gandhi once said “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.”  

Here, I am planning to give you some quick tips on a step by step approach towards learning in ML/AI. I will also provide recommendations if you are looking to get a hands on experience in a follow up post. 

**_Step 0: Understand the definition of ML/AI_**

As per Machine Learning [Glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary) by Google, below are the definitions provided

**[Artificial Intelligence](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#artificial-intelligence)** is _a non-human program or model that can solve sophisticated tasks. For example, a program or model that translates text or a program or model that identifies diseases from radiologic images both exhibit artificial intelligence_. 

_Formally, **[machine learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#machine_learning)** is a subfield of artificial intelligence. However, in recent years, some organizations have begun using the terms artificial intelligence and machine learning interchangeably._

Often I see the terms are being used as synonyms. 

The example of how I would differentiate is through its usage. 
Netflix has recently pitched in an idea of using (Eye Tracking for navigation)[https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-07-netflix-eye-nav-iphone-hack-day.html] of screens. This would fall under Artifical Intelligence whereas Netflix using Recommendation Engine to predict your next recommended video would come under machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence is a moving target as technology advancements grow in several fields this would keep evolving where as Machine Learning deals with predictive and/or reinforcement behavior.

**_Step 1: Understand the glossary_**

Understanding some key things in ML/AI is crucial as you are architecting a future solution. 

The key glossary items to know are
- Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement Learning
- Training vs Evaluation vs Inference
- Chatbots, Natural Language Processing/Understanding/Generation, Sentiment Analysis 

[Priyanka Vergadia](https://twitter.com/pvergadia/status/1356663694780887042?lang=en) walks you through the key things to learn in Machine Learning

Below are some of the other quick review material to get your hands around the topic.

**_Step 2: Understand three core pillars_**

For an AI driven solution, there are three core pillars. Data, Algorithms and Compute. For most conversations, understanding the terminology and glossary should be adequate. However I would like to highlight the most important of them all. 

**Data** fuels algorithms.  Anyone who has worked with ML/AI will tell you it's one of the prime examples for “garbage in and garbage out”. If your data fails, none of the sophisticated  models will work. It’s important to understand what is **data exploration, data wrangling, data cleansing, data mining, data transformation**. These concepts are generic with just a search might help. I liked this [article](https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/25/why-machine-learning-strategies-fail/) from Venturebeat which explains the importance of data for ML/AI as one of the top reasons Why Enterprises fail on their strategy.

Also important to understand how enterprises choose to do data lake/data mart/ data pond/data river or whatever they decide to call it.


**Algorithms** - There is a lot to learn and understand with Algorithms. Datascientists and some data engineers do really care with what algorithms to use. However for our purpose, its important to have a general idea on what these are. 

I like this by Jason Brownlee in [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/)

**_Step 3: Understand the players in this market_**

Every cloud provider has their unique strengths in their ML/AI portfolio. But these cloud providers are not the only ones; there are a lot of niche players in the market to keep a watch on. These are just some of the players offering products for the customers to build on their services. 

[Data Robot](https://www.datarobot.com/), [H2O.ai](https://www.h2o.ai/), [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com/),[Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/),[Data Bricks](https://databricks.com/)

In addition to these companies, there are SaaS providers offering AI solutions for most industries such as Banking, Insurance, Health care, Retail, Manufacturing etc.,

[Symphony Retail AI](https://www.symphonyretailai.com/) - Grocery store with AI

[Mitchell Intelligent Estimating](https://www.mitchell.com/mitchell-intelligent-estimating/) - Vehicle Damage Estimating Platform for Insurance 

[Path AI ](https://www.pathai.com/)- Accurate diagnosis of diseases

This list goes on and it helps you to understand how large this space really is and also every company focuses on how to make their customer lives a bit easier.

**_Step 4: Follow technologists and leaders in this space_**



There are many technologists in this space, follow them on social media. Most of them post great content for you to follow and understand. I tend to get some recent trends what they are working on and understanding how technology evolves from these players. 

I created a Twitter [list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1403493802678030342).  Do you have someone you follow? Send them to me so we can create a curated list

**_Step 5: Understand the principles major technology companies have for their governance_**

As organizations accelerate their adoption journey,there *needs* to be an ethical process on what can and cannot the organizations do. These ethical and responsible principles guide the way how end user customers are best served without bias, respectful of cultural/social norms, data security and privacy considerations.

For example, Nov'2019 when Apple announced Apple card by Goldman Sachs. There were[claims](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-card-issuer-investigated-over-gender-bias-in-credit-algorithm/) suggesting that the credit limit for men were substantially higher than women due to bias in the system. 

It’s important to understand how major companies think about AI in the real world and how ethically responsible they are. Here are some of the organizations and their principles

[Google](https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/ai-principles/)

[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/our-approach?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr5)

 As we look to become a more AI centric world, if this fails, we as a community would all fail.


To summarize, I have outlined how you could learn key words in ML/AI, the key player in a project, the data, companies providing infrastructure/solution in this space and how to keep yourself updated with the recent trends .

Keep learning, keep engaging, always be inquisitive and always be listening.
