Thank you for viewing my profile

## Intro:
I am Kanch. I am a self acknowledged technology addict. Curious about many things on cloud/ML currently. 

In my day job, I work as a Generative AI solutions leader. I work with customers to identify patterns of problems in the Data Engineering and AI agents space. We then work to create code samples, reference architectures, functional demos, and near production artifacts. 
In the data engineering with Generative AI, I led and managed the effort with [this](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/Open_Data_QnA) release and also released a [defensive publication](tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/6763/) 

I started as an engineer and have worked on all database products starting from hierarchical database to the most recent technologies such as Hive, Pig , HCatalog. I am always in the pursuit of self learning which encouraged me to gain my Masters in Information Systems Management from Harvard University Extension School. I keep myself current in the ever changing race of technology.

I have helped support customers with architecting AI / ML solutions to Google Cloud that ranges between multiple use cases with structured and unstructured data. I have also helped customers in strategizing their AI platform for the next gen technologies keeping the people/process and technology in mind. I have expertise and certifications from major cloud providers.

Personally , I am a mom of two. Most time spent being their personal chauffeur pre-covid days. I am learning Mandarin through Duolingo and its been a lot of fun.

## Intention for this blog:
Everyday is a learning experience when you are in tech , more with cloud as there are new services / features in the market almost everyday. 
This blog is intended to be my personal learning experience as I navigate this ever changing cloud race. 

Learning is a marathon and not a sprint. I would be drafting some common themes and learning experiences in this blog hoping its helpful for someone as you navigate this journey. I might be biased with Google Cloud options, thats because of the familiarity I have on the services. Every cloud provider has equivalent services with differentiating features. My hope for us is to understand the technology options and experiment with multiple cloud providers.

## Interests:
