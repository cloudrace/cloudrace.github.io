Thank you for viewing my profile. After 3 years of owning a domain, now is the time to get serious. 

## Intro:
I am Kanch. I am a self acknowledged technology addict. Curious about many things on cloud/ML currently. 

In my day job, I work in helping customers identify ML solutions for their business challenges. 

Personally , I am a mom of two. Most time spent being their personal chauffeur pre-covid days. I am learning Mandarin through Duolingo and its been a lot of fun.

## Intention for this blog:
Everyday is a learning experience when you are in tech , more with cloud as there are new services / features in the market almost everyday. 
This blog is intended to be my personal learning experience as I navigate this ever changing cloud race. 

Learning is a marathon and not a sprint. I would be drafting some common themes and learning experiences in this blog hoping its helpful for someone as you navigate this journey. I might be biased with Google Cloud options, thats because of the familiarity I have on the services. Every cloud provider has equivalent services with differentiating features. My hope for us is to understand the technology options and experiment with multiple cloud providers.

## Interests:

I enjoy speaking to varied set of audiences. Some of the talks I have given are

```
 Google Cloud Summits and Onboarding
 Guest lecturer for Cloud Computing Fundamentals and Streaming analytics at the Harvard Extension school since 2017
 Women in Tech forums with multiple enterprises - Big data Analytics and AI
 GDG Fests - Complex problems to simple : AI for everyone
 AI for kids - 7 to 11 year olds
 Grace Hopper - Hour of code - 7 to 11 year olds
```

My interests lie in a broad spectrum of AI.\
