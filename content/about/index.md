## Intention for this blog:
Everyday is a learning experience when you are in tech , more with cloud as there are new services / features in the market almost everyday. 
This blog is intended to be my personal learning experience as I navigate this ever changing cloud race. 

Learning is a marathon and not a sprint. I would be drafting some common themes and learning experiences in this blog hoping its helpful for someone as you navigate this journey. I might be biased with Google Cloud options, thats because of the familiarity I have on the services. Every cloud provider has equivalent services with differentiating features. My hope for us is to understand the technology options and experiment with multiple cloud providers.

## Interests:

There are three interest areas I focus on.
```
  AI in Humanity - How would future change in our life with AI
  Mandarin - Learning Mandarin 
  Finance - Investing  and Real estate investing 

```
