## Project 1: Santa Wishing Machine

🎅✨ 🎄 𝑻𝒖𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑯𝒐𝒍𝒊𝒅𝒂𝒚 𝑫𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒎𝒔 𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒐 𝑫𝒊𝒈𝒊𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝑹𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 🎅✨ 🎄 


I’ve always believed that the best use of AI is to make the "impossible" feel like magic. 


Today, I’m excited to share a project (built in 4 hours) that does just that: 
𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑺𝒂𝒏𝒕𝒂 𝑾𝒊𝒔𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑴𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒆.


By stitching together the latest in generative frontier models with the tools that each of us can experiment with, we’ve built an end-to-end experience where holiday wishes are transformed into personalized cinematic moments.


𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑻𝒆𝒄𝒉 𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒄𝒌:
𝘎𝘦𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘪: For reasoning and intent understanding.
𝘝𝘦𝘰: For high-fidelity video generation.
𝘛𝘛𝘚: Bringing the spirit of the season to life through voice.
𝘚𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘤𝘩: Designing the UX 
𝘈𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘵𝘺: Creating the application.

Huge shoutout to G. Hussain Chinoy for his incredible support in fine-tuning the Veo outputs and perfecting the Santa voice adjustments. Getting the "𝑯𝒐-𝑯𝒐-𝑯𝒐" just right is harder than it looks!
